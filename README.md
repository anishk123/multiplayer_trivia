# Multiplayer Trivia

## The Game

The game consists of multiple rounds. In each round players are presented a question, a choice of answers, and have to select one answer within the allotted time (10 seconds or so). Players that chose a correct answer advance to the next round. Those who chose the wrong answers are eliminated. The game continues until thereâ€™s only one winner left.

## Important details

1. The game runs without any admin intervention
1. Multiple trivia games can run simultaneously.
1. A reasonably large number of players can participate in each game.
1. Each round displays if the choice was correct and how many players advance.
